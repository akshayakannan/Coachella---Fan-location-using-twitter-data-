# Coachella---Fan-location-using-twitter-data-

Project Description:

This project is based on identifying the fan locations using twitter data, who have tweeted about Coachella across the world as well as the United States using tweets. 
For first time users, twitter will ask them to login to your account!!
When I pulled data from twitter it contains both latitude and longitude data in some cases where the user has made them available.
